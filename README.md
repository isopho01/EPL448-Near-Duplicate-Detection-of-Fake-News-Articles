# EPL448-Near-Duplicate-Detection-of-Fake-News-Articles
Team Project for EPL448 Data Mining - Near Duplicate Detection of Fake News Articles 

# Overview
## Python files
* createDataset.py - Used to create out json results gossipcop_results.json and politifact_results.json. By running it with your chosen dataset it will append any new information from your dataset to our json dataset by crawling the web to find near duplicate candidates
* evaluations.py - Calculates some statistical data about our algorithms results, and makes the plots for the Precision and Recall
* extract_articles.py - Used to extract the appropriate data from eacch article (title, url, content). Called from createDataset.py
* google_search.py - Used to crawl Google to find similar documents for a given document's title and returns an array of the results. Called from createDataset.py
* main.py - Holds same general functions used in most of the other files
* minhash_lsh.py - Implementation of the Minhash algorithm using Locality Sensitive Hashing and saves the results in the lsh_dataset.csv
* simhash1.py - Implementation of the Simhash algorithm and saves the results in the simhash_dataset.csv

The minimalistic version of the politifact_fake.csv and gossipcop_fake.csv datasets are a result of the work done for the FakeNewsNet project here https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet#fakenewsnet.
The fake_news_domain_list.csv dataset was provided to us for the purpose of this assingment.
